This is a little side project to keep my javascript skills alive while working with different languages. 
And a playground for ES6, Behaviour driven development (BDD)

The project is an RPG game/system adapted from one of table RPG games. And attempt to replicate table game experience to PC. 

- It will include:
    - battle system 
    - story mode
    - interface written with reactjs or vuejs
