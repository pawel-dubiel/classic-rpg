Quickness
Basic Test 	Free Action
During combat, you test Agility to determine the order of initiative
(bonus dice from Quickness apply). The combatant with the highest
result goes first, followed by the next highest, and so on. In the case of
a tie, the character with the highest rank in Agility goes first. If there’s
still a tie, compare ranks in Quickness. Finally, should the combatants
still be equal, they test again until there’s a clear victor.
Quickness also comes into play whenever you would test your re-
flexes or reactions, such as catching a thrown object for example.
